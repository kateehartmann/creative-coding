    I wrote this text generator in Python on April 7, 2008, never distributed or
    exhibited it, and just found it recently among older files. On September 15,
    2019, I wrote this HTML/JavaScript implementation of the generator. In terms
    of the way text is generated, this version functions exactly as does the
    2008 Python program. The typography is different, as the Python program runs
    in a terminal window.

    above is the link to the original work that i modified.
    I liked this work because it it different than the others, which generate paragraphs of text 
    or lines at a time. This one felt like i could get a bit more creative. I chose to change the 
    purpose of it. The original is a sort of warning sign telling the reader how to complete a task. 
    I chose to make it more of a reminder list with a threat for not completing it. The first idea 
    I had was to use the names of a bunch of people in my life.
